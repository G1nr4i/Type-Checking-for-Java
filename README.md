Type-Checking in Java
CMSC 308 – Pair Activity
Member: Briñas, Zyrhus Vincent Q.

Description:
This file contains Java code examples that demonstrate different type-checking systems.

Included Files:
1. Java_StaticTyping.java
   - Shows a compile-time error when assigning a string to an int.
2. Java_StrongTyping.java
   - Shows that Java does not allow automatic type conversion between int and String.
3. Java_NominalTyping.java
   - Shows that Java checks compatibility based on class names (Dog and Cat are not interchangeable).

How to Run:
1. Go to https://www.onlinegdb.com/  
2. Paste the code or open each file link from my GitHub.
3. Click “Run” to see the results.

- Nominal Typing: https://onlinegdb.com/7cVgcSL30f

Notes:
Java uses Static, Strong, and Nominal typing.
It checks types before execution and requires manual conversions for safety.
